# Starting a Docker Meetup Group

Anyone interested in Docker can become an active member of the Docker community by becoming co-organizer of a Docker Meetup group.

<img class="float-right" src="{% static 'img/community/meetup-logo.jpg' %}" alt="Meetup logo">
If a Meetup group does not already exist in your area and you are willing to start a new one, the best way to proceed is to contact us so that we can create it for you. We will always agree to create a new Docker Meetup group as long as it makes sense geographically speaking.

If you have already created a Docker Meetup group that is fine, we will simply ask you to add us as a co-organizer so that we can ensure a consistent support to the group in terms of community and Meetup management.

Before contacting us to create a new Docker Meetup Group, take a look at our <a title="Meetup Groups page" href="{% url 'meetups' %}" target="_blank"> Meetup Groups page </a> to make sure a group does not already exist in the area

*	Contact other people interested in Docker to help you organize and promote future Meetups
*	Research High-Tech companies in your area willing to host a Docker Meetup event
*	Research what would be the best date(s) to schedule the Meetups based on availabilities with regard to competing events in the area and other calendar imperative

## Host a Docker Meetup

### Want to host a Docker Meetup?

We are always looking for new office space to host Docker Meetups. If your company is willing to host a Docker Meetup,
 please contact us by email at meetup@docker.io. Previous Docker Meetups have been hosted by companies such as
 Rackspace, Twitter, MongoDB, BrightCove, DigitlOcean, Viadeo and Edmodo

### How many attendees?

The company hosting the event fixes the number of attendees depending on their office size and availability. This number usually varies between 30 and 200.

### How long is a Docker Meetup?

Once again, each company hosting the event decides when does the meetup start, and how long it lasts. Usual meetups tend to last 2 hours, and start between 4pm and 6pm.
