## Events

We have a ton of events going on (see below), in many places around the world, in some occasions also via live streaming. Here
    is an overview of the events we know that are going on.

Many of our events happen in the form of a <a href="{% url 'meetups' %}">meetup</a>. These meetups are organized by people from the community to learn
    more about Docker and to share their experiences.
